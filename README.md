# 🎮 PygameForge #

PygameForge is a **modular framework built on top of Pygame** that makes 2D game development faster, cleaner, and more productive.  
It provides pre-built modules for **UI, Entities, Physics, and more** – while keeping the freedom and flexibility of raw Pygame.

---

## ✨ Features (Planned) ##

- 🧱 **Entities** → simple entity system with update & draw lifecycle  
- 🎛 **UI** → buttons, sliders, text fields, and menus ready to use  
- ⚡ **Physics** → collisions, gravity, basic rigid-body simulation  
- 🎨 **Animations** → sprite sheet manager and frame-based animations  
- 🔊 **Extras** → sound helpers, asset loader, scene management  

_All modules are optional – import only what you need._
